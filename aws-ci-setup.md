Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up a CI Pipeline Using Jenkins on AWS
Step 1: Set Up Your AWS Environment
Create an AWS Account:

If you don't have an AWS account, sign up at aws.amazon.com.
Launch an EC2 Instance:

Go to the EC2 dashboard and click "Launch Instance."
Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI), preferably an Ubuntu or Amazon Linux image.
Select an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier eligibility).
Configure instance details, storage, and tags as needed.
Configure the security group to allow traffic on required ports (e.g., 8080 for Jenkins, 22 for SSH).
Review and launch the instance. Note the key pair used for SSH access.
Connect to Your EC2 Instance:

Use SSH to connect to your EC2 instance:

ssh -i "your-key-pair.pem" ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
Step 2: Install Jenkins on Your EC2 Instance
Update the Instance:

Update the package manager and install required dependencies:


sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-11-jdk wget
Install Jenkins:

Add the Jenkins repository and import the GPG key:


wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
Install Jenkins:


sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y jenkins
Start Jenkins Service:

Start the Jenkins service:

sudo systemctl start jenkins
Enable Jenkins to start on boot:


sudo systemctl enable jenkins
Access Jenkins:

Open a web browser and go to http://your-ec2-public-ip:8080.
Retrieve the initial admin password:


sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Complete the initial setup wizard and install recommended plugins.
Create the first admin user.
Step 3: Configure Jenkins for CI/CD
Install Essential Plugins:

Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins."
Install necessary plugins such as:
GitHub Integration Plugin
Pipeline Plugin
Git Plugin
Credentials Plugin
Set Up Credentials:

Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Credentials" > "(global)" > "Add Credentials."
Add credentials for GitHub, DockerHub, or any other services required.
Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job:

Go to "New Item" and create a new Pipeline job.
Configure the job:
Define the project name and select "Pipeline."
Under the "Pipeline" section, configure the pipeline script (either directly or via a Jenkinsfile in your repository).
Define the Pipeline Script:

Use a Jenkinsfile stored in your repository. For example:


pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo Building...'
                // Add build commands here
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo Testing...'
                // Add test commands here
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo Deploying...'
                // Add deployment commands here
            }
        }
    }
}
Set Up Webhooks:

Configure webhooks on GitHub or your chosen Git service to trigger Jenkins builds automatically.
Step 4: Secure Your Jenkins Instance
Update Jenkins:

Regularly check for and install Jenkins updates.
Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Plugins" to update all available plugins.
Configure Security Settings:

Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure Global Security."
Enable security settings such as:
Enable Jenkins authentication.
Configure matrix-based security or role-based access control.
Enable CSRF protection.
Backup Jenkins:

Regularly backup Jenkins configurations and jobs.
Consider using plugins like ThinBackup for automated backups.
Step 5: Monitor and Maintain Your Jenkins Instance
Monitor Jenkins:

Use Jenkins logs and monitoring tools to keep an eye on your Jenkins instance.
Set up alerts for build failures and other issues.
Scale Jenkins:

Consider setting up Jenkins agents (slaves) to distribute the workload.
Use EC2 instances or Kubernetes for dynamic scaling.
Regular Maintenance:

Periodically review and clean up old jobs, artifacts, and plugins.
Optimize Jenkins performance by tuning configurations and resource allocation.
