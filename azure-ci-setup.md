Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up a CI Pipeline Using GitLab CI or Azure DevOps on Azure
Option 1: Setting Up a CI Pipeline Using GitLab CI on Azure
Step 1: Set Up Your Azure Environment

Create an Azure Account:

If you don't have an Azure account, sign up at azure.microsoft.com.
Create an Azure Virtual Machine (VM):

Go to the Azure portal and navigate to "Create a resource" > "Compute" > "Virtual Machine."
Configure the VM with appropriate settings (choose an operating system like Ubuntu or Windows Server).
Set up networking and ensure necessary ports (e.g., 22 for SSH) are open.
Review and create the VM.
Connect to your VM using SSH (for Linux VMs) or RDP (for Windows VMs).
Step 2: Install GitLab Runner on Your Azure VM

Add GitLab Runner Repository:

Follow the official GitLab documentation to add the GitLab Runner repository.
Install GitLab Runner:

Install GitLab Runner on your VM.
Register GitLab Runner:

Register the GitLab Runner with your GitLab instance by providing the GitLab URL and registration token.
Choose the executor type (e.g., shell, Docker) based on your requirements and available resources.
Step 3: Configure Your GitLab Project

Create or Access Your GitLab Project:

Create a new project or navigate to an existing project on GitLab where you want to set up the CI pipeline.
Create .gitlab-ci.yml File:

In the root of your GitLab repository, create a .gitlab-ci.yml file to define the stages, jobs, and scripts for the CI pipeline.
Define Pipeline Stages and Jobs:

Include stages such as build, test, and deploy in your .gitlab-ci.yml file.
Add appropriate jobs under each stage that execute build commands, run tests, and handle deployment.
Step 4: Trigger and Monitor Pipeline Jobs

Commit and Push Changes:

Commit and push the .gitlab-ci.yml file to your GitLab repository to trigger the CI pipeline.
Monitor Pipeline Execution:

Monitor the pipeline execution through the GitLab web interface.
Address any build or test failures based on the feedback from the pipeline jobs.
Step 5: Secure and Optimize Your Setup

Configure Security Settings:

Ensure your Azure VM is secured with appropriate network and access configurations.
Use GitLab's built-in security features to manage access control and environment protection.
Optimize Runner Performance:

Use caching and artifacts to speed up build times.
Scale your runners based on the load by configuring autoscaling if needed.
Option 2: Setting Up a CI Pipeline Using Azure DevOps on Azure
Step 1: Set Up Your Azure DevOps Environment

Create an Azure DevOps Organization:

Sign up for an Azure DevOps account at dev.azure.com.
Create an organization and a new project within the organization.
Set Up Azure Virtual Machines or Other Resources:

Provision Azure VMs or other necessary resources for build agents, if self-hosted agents are required.
Step 2: Install and Configure Azure Pipelines

Create a Pipeline in Azure DevOps:

Go to your Azure DevOps project and navigate to Pipelines > New Pipeline.
Select the source repository (e.g., GitHub, Azure Repos) containing your code.
Define Your Pipeline Using YAML:

Choose the YAML option to define the pipeline in a code file (azure-pipelines.yml) stored in your repository.
Write the YAML Pipeline Configuration:

Define the stages, jobs, and steps required for your build and deployment process in azure-pipelines.yml.
Step 3: Configure Azure DevOps Agent Pools

Using Microsoft-Hosted Agents:

For simpler setups, use Microsoft-hosted agents that Azure DevOps provides out of the box.
Using Self-Hosted Agents:

If using self-hosted agents, install and configure the Azure DevOps agent on your Azure VMs.
Register the agent with your organization’s agent pool in Azure DevOps.
Step 4: Implement the CI/CD Pipeline

Define Build and Test Stages:

Add stages to your pipeline for building and testing your code.
Use appropriate build and test commands, tools, and frameworks based on your project needs.
Define Deployment Stages:

Add deployment stages to your pipeline, defining tasks to deploy your application to Azure services (e.g., Azure App Service, Azure Kubernetes Service).
Step 5: Secure and Optimize Your Pipeline

Configure Access and Security:

Set up role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure DevOps to manage permissions.
Use environment variables and secrets management to store sensitive information securely.
Optimize Pipeline Performance:

Use caching strategies to reduce build times.
Monitor pipeline performance and optimize resource allocation.
Step 6: Trigger and Monitor Pipeline Jobs

Commit and Push Changes to Trigger Pipeline:

Commit and push the azure-pipelines.yml file to your repository to start the CI/CD process.
Monitor Pipeline Execution:

Use Azure DevOps’ pipeline dashboard to track the progress and status of your pipeline runs.
Inspect logs and results to identify and resolve any issues.
